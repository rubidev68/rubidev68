- 👋 Hi, I’m @rubidev68
- 👀 I'm interested in computer science in general and app development (Web and Flutter) in particular.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning several languages like Flutter (Dart), HTML, PHP7, CSS, JS and Python3 (among others with Raspberry pi 3) and to use GitHub too! 😅
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate on the creation of Flutter mobile applications or websites, preferably in French.
- 🖊️ You can see my creations on https://rubidev68.42web.io . Actually my biggest project is Commerstras: https://commerstras.fr (only in French sorry 🥲). I hope I can make it available on GitHub soon!
- 📫 You can join me by email : rubidev68@gmail.com or by Discord : rubidev68
